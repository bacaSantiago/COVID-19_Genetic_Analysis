# COVID-19 Genetic Analysis Project

Welcome to the COVID-19 Genetic Analysis Project repository. In this project, we utilize the R programming language to delve into the genetic aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, exploring its different variants and conducting an in-depth analysis of their genetic sequences.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a profound impact on global health, economies, and societies. Understanding the genetic makeup of the virus and its variants is crucial for developing effective diagnostic tools, treatments, and vaccines. This project focuses on the genetic analysis of different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the R programming language, aiming to provide insights into their similarities, differences, and potential implications.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files:

1. `Evidencia_1.Rmd`: This R Markdown document includes the analysis and interpretation of the genetic sequences of various COVID-19 variants using the R programming language. It covers data retrieval, sequence length calculations, nucleotide comparisons, GC content calculations, and reverse complement sequences.

2. `Alpha.fasta`, `Beta.fasta`, `Delta.fasta`, `Gamma.fasta`, `Omicron.fasta`, `Wuhan-Hu-1.fasta`: These FASTA format files contain the genetic sequences of different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They are used as input data for the analysis performed in the R Markdown document.

3. `Gr√°ficas` folder: This folder contains graphical visualizations generated during the analysis. It includes bar plots comparing nucleotide frequencies and other relevant visuals.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Analyze and compare the genetic sequences of various COVID-19 variants using the R programming language.
- Calculate and visualize the length and nucleotide composition of the sequences.
- Determine the GC content of each variant and its potential implications.
- Generate reverse complement sequences to explore genetic functionality.

The insights gained from this analysis contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus and its potential impact on its transmissibility, severity, and interactions with the host.

## Usage

To replicate or extend the analysis performed in this project, you can use the provided R Markdown file (`Evidencia_1.Rmd`) along with the sequence files (`Alpha.fasta`, `Beta.fasta`, etc.). Running the R Markdown file using the R programming language will generate visualizations and results similar to those presented in this repository.

Feel free to explore, analyze, and interpret the genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 variants on your own.
